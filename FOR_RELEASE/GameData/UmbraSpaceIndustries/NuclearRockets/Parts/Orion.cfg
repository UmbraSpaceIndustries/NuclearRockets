	description = The 'Orion' pulse drive was an idea hatched by an intern over at USI. Bombs in space?! That can't be a good idea. After the intern sent a concept image to Jebediah and told him he could go faster than he ever imagined possible, calls were made and the Orion was greenlighted for field-testing. Note: USI is not responsible for any damages caused by the Orion.
