	description = Despite multiple efforts by management to fire the intern responsible for leaking the Orion to Jebediah Kerman, she sent a new concept to the board of directors. "What if we used a giant sail to catch all that energy from the explosion?" At first they thought it was silly, but once again Jebediah made some calls and the project was greenlighted.
